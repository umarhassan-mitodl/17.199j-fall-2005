Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Description
-----------

Designed for students who have a working/research experience abroad, this course combines a practical and an academic understanding of the global economy and its impact on different economic sectors and careers. Participants will build on their own experiences, in a seminar designed to bring to light the broader implications and comparative aspects of these experiences.

The course introduces the main debates about the "new" global economy and their implications for practice and policy. Experts from academia and business will share their findings about, and direct experiences with, different aspects of globalization.

Readings and guest lectures will take into consideration the participants' backgrounds and focus. Students will present case studies drawn from their own experiences, or related to the industry, profession, academic field or country of their choice. A strong emphasis will be put on participation and comparative approaches.

A HASS Communicative Intensive Subject
--------------------------------------

This class fulfills the requirement for a HASS-CI subject. Therefore, your writing assignments will have to amount to at least 21 pages. A draft of your longer research paper will be commented and returned to you for revision and resubmission before grading.

The course format will also fulfill another objective for a HASS-CI subject: an opportunity for oral expression. Each student will make at least two oral presentations (power point suggested) and will participate in the discussion of other projects.

The HASS-CI subject also fulfills Phase One of the Writing Requirement for juniors and seniors. Students must receive a grade of B or better to pass Phase One.
